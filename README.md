# SQL: Complete a SQL join.
This project involved writing and executing SQL queries using various types of joins to combine data across multiple related tables in a database. The objective was to retrieve meaningful, connected information by using INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and RIGHT JOIN clauses based on shared key fields.

# Environments and Technologies Used.
- Google Cloud Virtual Machines.
- SQL (Structured Query Language).

# Operating Systems Used </h2>
- Linux.

# Actions and observations.
- First, we must identify which employees are using which machines. The data is located in the machines and employees tables.

- We must use a SQL INNER JOIN to return the records we need based on a connecting column. In this scenario, both tables include the device_id column, which weâ€™ll use to perform the join.

- We have now combined device_id column on the employees and machines tables, giving us a merged view of each machine assigned to an employee.
